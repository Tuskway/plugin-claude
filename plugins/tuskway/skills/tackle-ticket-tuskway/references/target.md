# Target resolution

Use this when the main skill says to resolve a workspace, epic, and ticket key. Do that before `ticket_get` and before any edit.

## URL

Take the path only. Drop userinfo, query, and fragment, and do not print a remote that still contains credentials.

`https://tuskway.com/w/fixture/epics/receipts/files?path=tickets%2FT2.md`

- workspace: `fixture`
- epic: `receipts`
- key, when the path is `tickets/<KEY>.md`: `T2`

A handoff line that contains that URL is enough. A different host with the same `/w/<workspace>/epics/<epic>/` path is the same shape.

## One workspace, or several

`epic_list` with no workspace argument returns the workspaces this session can access. Each item has a `slug`. When the list has one workspace, call `epic_list` again with that slug.

When it has several, list epics and compare `trackerRepo` with the delivery repo's origin:

- `git@github.com:acme/receipts.git` matches `acme/receipts`
- `https://github.com/acme/receipts.git` matches `acme/receipts`
- `https://gitlab.com/group/sub/receipts.git` matches `group/sub/receipts`

Match only a remote you read from the delivery repo the user named. Run the remote command in that directory, and use it only when that directory is the git toplevel. A fixture or package nested inside a larger checkout does not inherit the outer remote. No remote of its own means ask. Linear and Jira identifiers do not identify a delivery repo. Archived epics are omitted from the list unless you pass `includeArchived`; naming one still opens it in `epic_get`.

Zero matches, or more than one, means ask. A bare key such as `T5` does not choose an epic, even when only one of the candidates looks ready. Show the candidate slugs and titles. Do not pick the first row. Reading both briefs to compare them is allowed. Starting either one is not.

## Arguments

Read the schema the connected server exposes for the logical tool. A host may prefix the tool name. Call the tool only with values you already resolved. If a value is missing, ask the user. The argument is the value, not a sentence about the value.
